    "description": "The first ever collection of products that can be used ‘on-the-water’ as well as ‘in-the-water.’\n\nAfter years of creating and designing market-leading open water swim wetsuits, we have noticed an increased growth in other open air water sports, more specifically the sport of Stand Up Paddleboarding.\n\nStand Up Paddleboarding is one of the fastest growing water sports across the world at the moment and it’s easy to see why. It’s one of the most relaxing sports and can also be used as a way to help develop core stability and upper body strength. With that, we’ve decided to create a range of products that can be used for SUP, swimming and open water sports in general.\n\nStand Up Paddleboarding is an activity that is so enjoyable that you can end up working out for hours, where comfort and durability are paramount. We have strategically incorporated our most flexible neoprene panels to keep you comfortable, no matter how long you’re out, or how long your adventure.\n\nTHE DETAILS:\nExternal reinforced pockets.\nOur finest neoprene for flexibility.\nStrategically located durability panels.\nSoft-feel neck line.",
